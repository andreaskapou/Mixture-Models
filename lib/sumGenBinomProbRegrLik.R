# sumGenBinomProbRegrLik - Sum of Binomial distributed Probit Regression#
# Likelihood over all the dataset D, weighted by the corresponding      #
# responsibilites of each cluster. This function will be used in an     #
# Optimization procedure for the M-step of the EM algorithm             #
#                                                                       #
# Usage: res  <- sumGenBinomProbRegrLik(theta, D, post.resp)            #
#                                                                       #
# Input:                                                                #
#     theta   is a vector of the parameters of the function             #
#     D       is a list, where each entry contains a 3 by L dimensional #
#             matrix containing:                                        #
#         X.i is a vector (of length L) with the corresponding values   #
#               at each position for region i                           #
#         t.i is a vector (of length L) with the number of trials, in   #
#               the context of Binomal distributed data for region i    #
#         m.i is a vector (of length L) with the number of successes in #
#               the t trials for region i                               #
#     post.resp are the posterior probabilities, rersponsibility the    #
#               cluster k takes on data point x                         #
# Output:                                                               #
#     res     is the total log likelihood for all the regions i         #
#                                                                       #
