Finite Mixture Models using Gibbs Sampling

Code for modeling data using finite Dirichlet mixture models using a Bayesian approach.

It is implemented for Gaussian mixtures, Binomial mixtures and Poisson mixtures. 
For the Bayesian approach we have set priors on the parameters of each distribution.
Also we have set a Dirichlet prior for the mixing proportions.
